# Exercise 3.2

This is a modification of exercise 3.1. 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Your program should then convert it to Fahrenheit and displays the result in the form:
```
X Celsius is equivalent to Y Fahrenheit.
```
For example if the user inputted ``20.2`` the program output in the **console** will look like:
```
Please enter the temperature in Celsius:
20.2
20.2 Celsius is equivalent to 68.36 Fahrenheit.
```
* Your program should accept decimals such as ``25.3``
* Your program should only calculate the result and display it if the user enters a value that is greater than or equal to zero. 
* If the user enters a value that is less than ``0``, the program should display the following:
```
ERROR: You must enter a value of 0 or greater.
```
For example if the user inputted ``-2`` the program output in the **console** will look like:

```
Please enter the temperature in Celsius:
-2
ERROR: You must enter a value of 0 or greater.
```

***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output given by the example output, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
