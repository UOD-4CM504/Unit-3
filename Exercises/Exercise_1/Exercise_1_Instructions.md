# Exercise 3.1  

You can use exercise 2.1 from last week as a starting point.


The formula to convert a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```Fahrenheit = (9/5) * Celsius + 32```


Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Your program should then convert it to Fahrenheit and displays the result in the form:

```
X Celsius is equivalent to Y Fahrenheit.
```
For example if the user inputted ``20.2`` the program output in the **console** will look like:
```
Please enter the temperature in Celsius:
20.2
20.2 Celsius is equivalent to 68.36 Fahrenheit.
```
* Your program should accept decimals such as ``25.3``
* Your program should only calculate the result and display it if the user enters a value that is greater than or equal to zero. 
* If the user enters a value that is less than ``0``, the program should not display anything.
```
Please enter the temperature in Celsius:
-1
```

***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
